# Introduction to R as a GIS

Code for an introduction to using R to join spatial data to census tracts and explore patterns, featured at [my blog](https://michaeljoseph04.github.io/blog/project/2019/04/03/R-GIS-introduction.html). The code includes:

- Importing spatial data into R
- Performing a spatial join
- Visualizing spatial data
- Other spatial operations (a dissolve) and joining to US Census tracts
- Looking for trends with US Census data
