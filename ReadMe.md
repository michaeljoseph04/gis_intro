## GIS in R

*An Introduction to using R as a GIS for urban spatial analysts*

As an urban planner and policy analyst, I have to do a lot of data analysis of spatial data. But there are few good introductions to the types of analyses which are common and useful, and how to go about them. This brief tutorial and the accompanying code should guide readers through some of this territory. Nothing too advanced--I will leave most GIScience and spatial analysis for future posts--but everything should be extremely clear, and the workflows should be the most optimal for data analysis. I'll cover:

- Importing spatial data into R
- Visualizing spatial data
- Performing a spatial join
- Performing a dissolve
- Performing basic spatial analysis data exploration
